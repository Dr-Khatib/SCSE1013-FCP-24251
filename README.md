FUNDAMENTAL CONCEPT PROGRAMMING

# Course Information: SCSE1013-Fundamental Concept Programming

## Course Description
This course provides students with a solid foundation in computational thinking, problem-solving strategies, and the fundamentals of programming. Students will develop programming skills by learning basic concepts, control structures, functions, arrays, and pointers. Towards the end, the course will explore structured data and transform these skills into object-oriented programming principles, preparing students to write efficient and modular programs.
